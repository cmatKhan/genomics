 ----> reverse complement and scoring matrix

Question 1:
{Score for highest affinity binding site for the TF scoring matrix}
{Sequence(s) corresponding to highest affinity binding site for the TF scoring matrix}
{Score for highest affinity binding site for the polymerase scoring matrix}
{Sequence(s) corresponding to highest affinity binding site for the polymerase scoring matrix}
{Explain how you arrived at your answer.}
{If you wrote a script, provide the command to run it.}

{Output of command}
{Command to run scan_sequence.py on the polymerase and promoter1}
{Output of command}
{Command to run scan_sequence.py on the polymerase and promoter2}
{Output of command}
{Name of the promoter that you'd expect to be repressed by the TF}
