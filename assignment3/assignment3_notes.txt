download sequence from yeast genome site

use blast per instructions, changing score

change algorithm parameters

max target sequence to 250

after blast, align reads with bowtie

create index for chr22 (provided in assignment 3, symlink)

bowtie2-build to build index

bowtie2 will give options, etc -- pay attention to the options

reads we will be aligning are in reads.fq (in assignment3 dir)

these are UNPAIRED reads

save both alignment output and report

compare nuc and dinuc. Don't need to edit nuc_count_FINAL, just run it.

EC

ID species and turn in output from running blast
