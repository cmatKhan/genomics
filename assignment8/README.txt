Part I


Question 1:
{Exact command to run count_gv.py}
{Output count table}
-
Question 2:
{Proportion of genomic variants are SVs} 
-
Question 3:
{Describe the spectrum of SVs for the individual NA12878}
-
Question 4:
{Place the three histograms in your submission directory}
{Describe the distributions observed in each of the histograms}
{Speculate how the length distribution might differ if we limit the data to exonic indels?}
-
Part II


Question 5:
{Exact command to run quantify_genotype.py}
{Output count table}
-
Question 6:
{Does the difference in the number of homozygous alternate (or non-reference homozygous) and heterozygous SNVs and indels, make biological sense? Why, or why not}
-
Question 7:
{How many variants clearly violate the rules of Mendelian segregation? (Autosome only)}
-
Question 8:
{Describe four potential reasons that could explain the Mendelian violations.}
-
Question 9:
{How many variants now violate mendelian segregation after filtering? (Autosome only)}
-
Comments:
{Things that went wrong or you can not figure out}
-
Suggestions:
{What programming and/or genomics topics should the TAs cover in the next class that would have made this assignment go smoother?}
